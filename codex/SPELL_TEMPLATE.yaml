# NOTES FOR STANDARDIZATION:
# 1. Always use "recharge_time" at root level, never "recharge" in conditions
# 2. Always use new affinity format with école_requirement/type_requirement/mixed_requirement
# 3. Use consistent time format: "X sec" (not "X secs"), "instantané", never "aucun"
# 4. Prerequisites go in prerequisites section, conditions in conditions section
# 5. Special effects go in effects.special, not scattered in other sections
# 6. All levels are strings ("1", "2") not integers (1, 2)
# 7. school and type are at root level, not inside levels
# 8. RESISTANCE SYSTEM: Specify which resistance applies to damage:
#    - RMEC (Résistance Mécanique): projectiles, impacts, pressure, shockwaves
#    - RRAD (Résistance Radiative): fire, cold, light, electricity, radiation
#    - RINT (Résistance Interne): drain, necrosis, corruption, internal effects
